You might sigv on the following maps format:

    - A map without '\n' at the very end, for example:
        
        #####$
        #PXO#$
        #####
        
    - A map with different line sizes, for example:

        #$
        ##$
        #O#$
        #X #$
        #  P#$
        ######$

    - A basic free map, for example:

        #   #$
         PXO $
        #   #$

    - A free map with different line sizes, for example:

        #$
          $
        OX $
           P$
        #   #$


Those are the most popular crashes reason,
But those other possibly sigv your program too:

    - A map without 'P'
    - A map with two following '\n' or more
    - A map with only one line/column
    - A free map like the following one: PXO$
    - When you want to push a box out of the bounds
    - An empty map???
    - A map with only a '\n' like the following one: $
    - A map with a final '\n', depends on how did you managed your map
